My GitHub Account: katukojwalark, URL: https://github.com/katukojwalark
    Repository: rk_web_fs, URL: https://github.com/katukojwalark/rk_web_fs

Steps I followed:
    1. Create a branch, we do not work on the main branch. Youucan create it from the github branch dropdown or use a git commnd 'git checout my-branch'
    2. Adding the upstream for 'rk_web_fs': 
        $ git remote add upstream  https://github.com/katukojwalark/rk_web_fs
    3. Adding the Origin: 
        $ git remote add origin https://github.com/katukojwalark/rk_web_fs.git (copy this Link from the drop down code from your main branch)
    4. Check for the Upstream and Origin: 
        $ git remote -v
        
        You should see the Origin and Upstream for fetch and push as follows,

        $ git remote -v
        origin  https://github.com/katukojwalark/rk_web_fs.git (fetch)
        origin  https://github.com/katukojwalark/rk_web_fs.git (push)
        upstream        https://github.com/katukojwalark/rk_web_fs (fetch)
        upstream        https://github.com/katukojwalark/rk_web_fs (push)
    5. Fetch upstream: downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. 
        Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on.

        $ git fetch upstream

    6. Update your codebase:

        $ git rebase upstream/main

    7. Make your code changes.  You have already created the branch. If not created, use $ git checkout -b my-branch-name. This command will creates and switches you  to the created branch.
    8. You have made your code changes check the files that are modified or added using,

        $ git status

    9. Now you can stage the files you are about to commit using $ git add file-name or you can stage all, if you find the status displays only the files you want to commt

        $ git add .

    10. You have staged your changes and are ready to commit to your peersonal branch.  Double check the files that you want to commit using the,
        
        $ git status

    11. $ git commit or git commit -m "my message desccribing the commiting changes"

    12. You have commited the changes to your personal branch. You need to share it to others to get the code reviews done.

        $ git push origin rk-branch

    13. Go to GitHub and raise PR from there. GitHub highlights a message like " rk-branch had recent pushes less than a minute ago" with a button "Compare & pull request" clic it
    14. On successful review merge your changes to the main branch. (Do this on GitHub)
Layout:
